Data preparation for bike-share demand forecasting.
=====================================================

CONTRACT — implement these so the rest of the pipeline works. Keep the signatures;
your AI agent fills the bodies.

This module is responsible for turning the raw hourly CSV into a clean, leakage-free,
feature-rich DataFrame ready for modelling.
